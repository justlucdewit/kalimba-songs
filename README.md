# Kalimba songs

### About this repository
This repository is my library of kalimba songs, some are copies from other covers, some modified versions. All of them are in the C Major scale. Feel free to add to this repository by creating a new file and using the notation that I use, or make a song request by making an issue on this repository.

### The notation
For the notation I use the following method:

- Notes are notated with a number or a letter `1 or C` `2 or D` `3 or E` etc.

- When the note is followed with a dot, its frequency is raised to the next octave, when there are 2 dots its raised 2 octaves.

- Parenthesis can be used to indicate that 2 or more notes must be played at the same time. for example to play the note 3, then 2 and 1 together, then 1, that is notated by `3 (1 2) 1`

- Comments can be placed with `# the comment here`

- Square brackets can be used to group a sequence of notes together: `[3 2 1]`

- You can repeat a group 4 times by placing x4 after the group `[3 2 1]x4`

- You can name a group by writing the name and then equals:
```
sequence_up = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
sequence_down = [7 6 5 4 3 2 1]

sequence_up sequence_down sequence_up sequence_down
```

- There is no way yet to notate the note lengths

- All songs are designed for the 17 key kalimba tuned to C Major
