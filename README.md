# Kalimba songs

### About this repository
This repository is my library of kalimba songs, some are copies from other covers, some modified versions. All of them are in the C Major scale. Feel free to add to this repository by creating a new file and using the notation that I use, or make a song request by making an issue on this repository.

### The notation
For the notation I use the following method:

- Notes are notated with a number or a letter `1 or C` `2 or D` `3 or E` etc.

- When the note is followed with a dot, its frequency is raised to the next octave, when there are 2 dots its raised 2 octaves.

- Parenthesis can be used to indicate that 2 or more notes must be played at the same time. for example to play the note 3, then 2 and 1 together, then 1, that is notated by `3 (1 2) 1`

- There is no way yet to notate the note lengths

- All songs are designed for the 17 key kalimba tuned to C Major
